ECON 101: Intermediate Macroeconomics
This course is about foundational theories in macroeconomics, with a computational touch. My aim is to introduce all topics in the regular curricula from three perspectives: 1) Conceptual (i.e., understanding the underlying ideas), 2) Mathematical (i.e., doing the math), and 3) Simulated (i.e., testing implications of the theory with R). 


You will learn all the R programming you need during the first three weeks of the semester. So don’t worry if you never programmed or used R before. I believe a basic knowledge of programming will help you best prepare for the future workforce, which is why I have added it to the class. We will use R to visualize data, simulate trajectories of growth models, and run basic statistics (including regression). 


The first ¾ of the class will be dedicated to the economic theories, programming fundamentals, and foundational topics that make up the requirements for intermediate macroeconomics. That is, the Classical model, Classical Monetary System & Inflation, Classical Economic Growth, Keynesian economics & IS-LM model, and Open-Economy models. The remaining ¼ will cover an introduction to Econometrics and modern methods in macroeconomic modeling. The hope of this additional fourth is to briefly show you methods you will use if you continue your final project or career in economics, as well as present new approaches being considered by central banks and economic modelers today. 


Expect this to be a hands-on class. There are no exams in this class. Your grading will be a weighted average of the quizzes, participation, homeworks, and final project. Each quiz is meant to test your conceptual recall and mathematical skills, these will be 15 minutes long each. Refer to homework sheets for more information about specific assignments, these will allow you to develop your writing and programming skills. The final project is the most important component of the class, you should see it as an opportunity to build something for your portfolio that you are proud to show your peers, job interviewers, or other faculty. The only condition on the final project is that it must have Theoretical + Math + Programming components. 


Here are some project ideas:

* Analyze some of the policies proposed by presidential candidates based on supply and demand effects
* Assess the macroeconomic performance on the four key indicators of one or more countries based on a few different metrics. Do different measurements tell different stories? 
* Estimate the effect of COVID on an economic variable(s) of interest (e.g., unemployment rate, savings deposits, credit, gdp growth, etc.) using Linear Regression
* Simulate and interpret possible trajectory paths of the Solow-Swan growth model. 
* Why did Average Hourly Earning in the Private sector increase sharply during the pandemic?
* What drove the increase of the Industrial Production Index (INDPRO) in 2021?
* What is the impact of interest rate change on goods & services versus asset inflation?

Overview
Quizzes will be held every Thursday at the beginning of class, and no calculators will be needed. All assignments, including essays and lab reports, are due by 11:59 PM on either Friday or Sunday (ask for preference). You will have around 2 weeks for each assignment. Additionally, all R labs must be submitted as R markdown notebooks, with all text and descriptions written within the notebook using markdown.
