# ECON 101: Intermediate Macroeconomics

## Course Description

This course covers foundational theories in macroeconomics with a computational approach. Topics are introduced from three perspectives:
1. Conceptual (understanding underlying ideas)
2. Mathematical (doing the math)
3. Simulated (testing implications of the theory with R)

R programming will be taught during the first three weeks. No prior programming experience is required.

### Course Structure
- First 3/4: Economic theories, programming fundamentals, and foundational topics
- Last 1/4: Introduction to Econometrics and modern methods in macroeconomic modeling
