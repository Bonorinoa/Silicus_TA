# Classical Monetary Policy and Inflation

## 1. Monetary Policy Instruments

There are two main types of instruments the central bank can use to indirectly control the money supply:
1. Those that influence the monetary base
2. Those that influence the reserve-deposit ratio

### 1.1 The Federal Reserve (Fed)

- Central bank of the United States
- Monetary policy is delegated to the Federal Reserve, a partially independent institution
- Decisions made by the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
- FOMC composition:
  1. Members of the Federal Reserve Board (appointed by president, confirmed by Senate)
  2. Presidents of regional Federal Reserve Banks (chosen by banks' boards of directors)
- FOMC meets about every six weeks to discuss and set monetary policy

### 1.2 Monetary Base Control

#### Open Market Operations (OMOs)
- Buying or selling government bonds (treasuries)
- Conducted by the Trading Desk at the New York Fed
- Effects:
  - Buying bonds increases monetary base (injects money into economy)
  - Selling bonds decreases monetary base
- Specific securities detailed in section 14 of the Federal Reserve Act

#### Lending to Banks
- Fed acts as lender of last resort
- Controversial due to perception of bailing out banks
- Lending occurs at the discount window
- Discount rate: interest charged by Fed to banks
- Lower discount rate increases monetary base and money supply
- Example: If MB = C + R, and Fed buys $1M of bonds, new MB = MB + $1M

### 1.3 Reserve-Deposit Ratio Control

- Fed sets reserve requirements
- Directly determines the reserve-deposit ratio (rr in model)
- Less efficient after 2008 financial crisis due to excess reserves
- Reasons for excess reserves:
  - Decreased loan interest rates
  - Fed paying interest on reserves
- Interest on reserves:
  - New instrument introduced post-2008
  - Increase in interest rate on reserves tends to increase reserve-deposit ratio, lower money multiplier, and lower money supply

### 1.4 Quantitative Easing (QE)

- Buying long-term treasuries
- Effects similar to OMOs but focuses on long-term securities
- Example: Mortgage-backed securities during 2008/09 crisis
- Results from 2007 to 2014:
  - Monetary base grew 400%
  - M1 grew 100%
  - M2 grew 55%
- Decrease in money multiplier due to increased reserve-deposit ratio
- Reason: Banks holding excess reserves, making fewer loans

## 2. Inflation

Definition: Overall increase in prices (from a basket of goods)

### 2.1 Measurement Issues

- Construction of the basket
- Limitations of index measures
- Potential for digital economy to improve price monitoring
- In US, primarily measured by changes in CPI

### 2.2 Inflation Rate

- Percentage change in the overall level of prices
- Hyperinflation: 50% per month or higher (approximately 12,800% annually)
- Effects of high inflation:
  - Behavioral changes in consumption decisions
  - Increased economic volatility
  - Decreased trust in currency and institutions
  - Reduced effectiveness of monetary policy

### 2.3 Quantity Theory of Money

Main equation: MV = PY (nominal GDP)

Where:
- M: Money supply
- V: Velocity of money (rate at which money circulates in economy)
- P: Price level
- Y: Ouput or Income (or quantity of transactions more generally)

#### Assumptions
1. V is constant, primarily determined by the other three variables
2. Y is not affected by M, V, or P (determined by supply of K and L, and current technology)

#### Implications
- Changes in money supply lead to proportional changes in price level
- "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon" - Milton Friedman

Building blocks:
1. Output Y determined by production function
2. Money supply M set by central bank, determines nominal GDP (PY) if V is fixed
3. Price level P is ratio of nominal GDP (PY) to output Y

Inflation equation: %ΔM + %ΔV = %ΔP + %ΔY

### 2.4 Interest Rates

Two types:
1. Nominal: Rate banks pay
2. Real: Rate adjusted for inflation

Fisher Equation: i = r + π

Where:
- i: Nominal interest rate
- r: Real interest rate
- π: Inflation rate

Fisher Effect: One-for-one relation between inflation rate and nominal interest rate

Note: In practice, expected inflation rates are used due to difficulty in predicting actual inflation

Current inflation theory: π = supply shocks + slack + expectations

## 3. The Classical Dichotomy

Separation of the economy into real and nominal sectors:
- Real variables: Measured in physical units (e.g., real wages, output quantities, relative prices)
- Nominal variables: Measured in money units (e.g., price level, inflation rate, actual income after taxes)

### 3.1 Monetary Neutrality

- Money supply only affects nominal variables in the long run
- Real variables determined endogenously (by technology, preferences, institutions)
- Allows study of real variables while ignoring nominal variables

### 3.2 Types of Inflation

1. Variable inflation: Costly due to increased uncertainty, inequality, decision-making difficulties
2. Steady inflation: More manageable as expectations can adjust

### 3.3 Costs of Steady Moderate Inflation

1. Inflation tax: Cash loses value (more significant in emerging economies)
2. Menu costs: Changing prices (becoming less significant with digitization)
3. Shoe leather costs: Economizing on cash (less significant with modern banking)

## 4. Modern Monetary Theory (MMT)

Key ideas:
- Monetary sovereignty gives governments more fiscal flexibility
- Inflation, not revenue, is the main constraint on government spending
- Taxes and bonds are tools to manage inflation, not fund spending
- A job guarantee could promote full employment and price stability

Criticisms:
- Underestimates inflation risks
- Could lead to currency devaluation
- Faces significant political hurdles
- Debates about functionality in a globally interconnected economy
