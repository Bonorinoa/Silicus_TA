# Classical Demand Theory in Macroeconomics

## 1. Introduction

This section builds on the supply side of the classical model, focusing on the demand side of the economy. We'll examine how GDP is allocated among its key components: Consumption, Investment, and Government purchases.

## 2. Components of GDP

In a closed economy (no imports or exports), GDP is composed of:
- Consumption (C)
- Investment (I)
- Government purchases (G)

Expressed as: GDP = C + I + G

## 3. Consumption

### 3.1 Consumption Function

Consumption is primarily determined by disposable income:

C = C(Y - T)

Where:
- C: Consumption
- Y: Total income (equivalent to output in the classical model)
- T: Taxes (assumed to be lump-sum in this simple model)

### 3.2 Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)

MPC is defined as the increase in consumption for each additional dollar of disposable income:

MPC = ΔC / Δ(Y - T)

Classical assumption: MPC is stable and between 0 and 1.

### 3.3 Example of MPC Calculation

Given:
| Disposable Income | Consumption |
|-------------------|-------------|
| 100               | 160         |
| 180               | 210         |

MPC = (210 - 160) / (180 - 100) = 50 / 80 = 0.625

### 3.4 Real-World Considerations

Recent evidence suggests MPC may not always be stable or between 0 and 1:
- If borrowing exceeds income, MPC > 1
- If higher income discourages consumption, MPC < 0

### 3.5 COVID-19 Cash Transfers Effect on MPC

1. Increased savings due to economic uncertainty led to lower than expected MPC.
2. Limited spending options during lockdowns affected consumption patterns.
3. Debt repayment using stimulus funds resulted in lower observed MPC.
4. Heterogeneity in MPC across income groups:
   - Lower-income groups: Higher MPC due to liquidity constraints
   - Higher-income groups: Lower MPC, increased savings or stock market speculation

### 3.6 Limitations of the Classical Consumption Function

1. Assumes current disposable income as the primary determinant, ignoring factors like wealth, credit availability, and expectations.
2. Doesn't account for differences in consumption patterns across income levels or changes in income distribution.
3. Assumption of a stable MPC may not hold during economic crises or rapid growth periods.

## 4. Investment

### 4.1 Investment Function

Investment is primarily determined by the interest rate:

I = I(r)

Where:
- I: Investment
- r: Real interest rate

### 4.2 Key Characteristics of the Investment Function

1. Inverse relationship with the interest rate: As r increases, fewer investment projects are profitable, leading to a decrease in investment.
2. Downward sloping: The investment demand curve slopes downward, reflecting the negative relationship between investment and the interest rate.

### 4.3 Multiple Interest Rates in Reality

Factors affecting interest rates:
1. Term (duration of the loan)
2. Credit risk
3. Tax treatment

Despite multiple interest rates, macroeconomists often assume a single interest rate for simplification.

### 4.4 Example of a Linear Investment Function

I = e - dr

Where:
- e: Autonomous investment
- d: Sensitivity of investment to changes in the interest rate

Example: I = 1000 - 50r
a) When r = 5%, I = 750
b) When r increases to 7%, I decreases to 650 (change of -100)
c) Zero investment occurs at r = 20%

### 4.5 Limitations of the Classical Investment Function

1. Assumes perfect information about future returns on investment projects.
2. Doesn't explicitly account for uncertainty and risk.
3. Doesn't capture potential "animal spirits" or irrational exuberance in driving investment booms and busts.

## 5. Government

### 5.1 Types of Government Purchases

1. Spending: Exchanges for goods or services (e.g., public sector wages, infrastructure projects, military expenses)
2. Transfers: Direct payments not related to production (e.g., social security, Medicare)

Note: Only spending (G) is included in the GDP equation.

### 5.2 Government Budget Scenarios

1. G = T: Balanced budget
2. G < T: Budget deficit (often funded by increasing debt)
3. G > T: Budget surplus (can be used to repay existing debt)

### 5.3 Classical Approach to Government Role

Classical economists favored limited government intervention:
- Protecting property rights
- Providing public goods
- Maintaining competitive markets

### 5.4 Limitations of the Classical Approach to Government Expenditure

1. Assumes perfect information and rational expectations
2. Neglects potential stimulative effects of government spending during recessions
3. Doesn't account for potential productivity-enhancing effects of certain types of government expenditure

## 6. Equilibrium in the Classical Model

### 6.1 Aggregate Supply and Demand Equation

Y = C(Y - T) + I(r) + G

Where:
- Y: Total output (supply)
- C(Y - T): Consumption function
- I(r): Investment function
- G: Government purchases

### 6.2 Role of Interest Rate

The interest rate (r) is the key variable for equilibrating supply and demand:
- If r is too high: Investment is too low, demand falls short of supply
- If r is too low: Investment is too high, demand exceeds supply
- At equilibrium r: Demand for goods and services equals the supply

### 6.3 Loanable Funds Market

The role of the interest rate can be better understood by examining the financial markets, specifically the loanable funds market.
