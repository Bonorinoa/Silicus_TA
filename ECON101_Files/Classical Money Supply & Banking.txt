# Classical Monetary System and Banking

## 1. Introduction to Money

Definition: Stock of assets used to make transactions

### 1.1 Brief History of Money

1. Cattle (8000 BCE): First currency
2. Bread: Used after agricultural development
3. Metal coins: Solved value storage issues
4. Paper money: Improved portability and divisibility

### 1.2 Types of Money

1. Fiat money: No intrinsic value, established by government decree (e.g., dollars, pesos)
2. Commodity money: Pegged to a commodity (e.g., gold standard)
3. Digital money: Electronic representations of fiat money

Emerging alternatives:
- Cryptocurrencies: Digital money not backed by government or financial institutions
- Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs): Government-created cryptocurrencies

### 1.3 Properties of Money

1. Unit of account
2. Store of value
3. Medium of exchange

Underlying factor: Trust

## 2. Ledgers

Definition: Collections of accounts where transactions are recorded

### 2.1 Evolution of Ledgers

1. Clay tablets (2400 BC): Mesopotamia
2. Paper ledgers: Durable, affordable, portable, but with limitations
3. Digital ledgers (1970s): Reduced input errors, increased transaction speed
4. Blockchain: Distributed ledger technology

## 3. Money Supply

Definition: Quantity of money available in an economy

### 3.1 Controlling Money Supply

- In commodity money systems: Quantity of the commodity
- In fiat money systems: Government control through monetary policy

### 3.2 Open Market Operations

- Main tool for controlling money supply
- Buying government bonds: Increases money supply
- Selling government bonds: Decreases money supply

### 3.3 Measuring Money Supply

- M0: Currency
- M1: M0 + traveler's checks, demand deposits, other checkable deposits
- M2: M1 + short-term assets, money market mutual funds, saving accounts

Note: Credit is not included in money supply measures

## 4. The Role of Banks

### 4.1 Fractional Reserve Banking

- Banks keep a fraction of deposits as reserves
- Enables money creation through loans

Example:
Assets | Liabilities
-------|------------
200 (reserve) | 1000 (deposits)
800 (loan) | 

Money supply increase: 1000 (original deposit) + 800 (loan) = 1800

### 4.2 Money Multiplier

Formula: Total money created = Original deposit * (1/reserve ratio)

Example: 1000 * (1/0.2) = 5000

### 4.3 Bank Balance Sheet

Assets | Liabilities
-------|------------
200 (reserves) | 750 (deposits)
500 (loans) | 200 (debt)
300 (securities) | 50 (bank capital)

### 4.4 Leverage in Banking

Leverage ratio = Total assets / Bank capital

Example: 1000/50 = 20 (20 to 1 leverage ratio)

Risks:
- 5% drop in asset value can wipe out bank capital
- Insolvency if assets fall below liabilities

Historical example: Lehman Brothers (30 to 1 leverage ratio in 2008)

## 5. Model of Money Supply and Creation

Exogenous variables:
1. Monetary base (MB): Currency + reserves
2. Reserve-Deposit ratio (rr): Determined by bank policies and regulations
3. Currency-Deposit ratio (cr): Household preferences for cash vs. deposits

### 5.1 Money Supply Equation

MS = C + D
MB = C + R

Where:
- MS: Money supply
- C: Currency
- D: Deposits
- R: Reserves

### 5.2 Money Multiplier

m = (1 + cr) / (rr + cr)

Money supply equation: MS = m * MB

### 5.3 Effects of Changes in Exogenous Variables

1. Increase in monetary base: Proportional increase in money supply
2. Decrease in reserve-deposit ratio: Increases money multiplier and money supply
3. Decrease in currency-deposit ratio: Increases money multiplier and money supply
