# Loanable Funds Market in Classical Economics

## 1. National Income Accounts Identity

Y = C + I + G

Where:
- Y: Output
- C: Consumption
- I: Investment
- G: Government purchases

## 2. Savings and Investment

National saving (S) = Y - C - G
S = I (Saving equals Investment)

### 2.1 Types of Savings

S = (Y - T - C) + (T - G)
- (Y - T - C): Private savings
- (T - G): Public savings

## 3. Model Equations

1. Y = F(K, L)
2. C = C(Y - T)
3. I = I(r)
4. G = G̅
5. T = T̅

Where:
- r: Real interest rate
- K: Capital
- L: Labor
- T: Taxes

## 4. Loanable Funds Market

- Supply of loans: Saving (S)
- Demand for loans: Investment (I)
- Price of loans: Interest rate (r)

### 4.1 Investment Function

I = I(r)
- Downward sloping: As interest rate decreases, more investment projects become profitable

### 4.2 Savings Function

In this model, savings is vertical (fixed) as it doesn't depend on the interest rate

## 5. Determinants of Investment

1. Expected return on investment projects
2. Business confidence and expectations
3. Technological progress
4. Tax policies affecting after-tax return
5. Depreciation rates of existing capital stock

## 6. Policy Implications

### 6.1 Increase in Government Spending

Effect: S = (Y - T - C(Y-T)) + (T - G)
- Decreases public savings
- National savings decreases
- Interest rate increases
- Investment decreases (crowding out)

Result: ΔI = -ΔG (100% crowding out) and only the composition of AD changes

### 6.2 Tax Cut

Effect on Savings: dS/dT = -(1 - MPC)
Where MPC: Marginal Propensity to Consume

Example:
- Tax decrease: 100
- MPC: 0.6
- Change in Savings: -60
- Change in public savings = -100
- Change in private savings = 40
- Change in consumption = 60

Result:
- Supply of loans falls
- Interest rate rises
- Investment shrinks
- Increase in consumption offsets decrease in investment
- Only the composition of AD changes

### 6.3 Business Optimism

Effect:
- Investment curve shifts out
- Real interest rate rises
- Without increase in savings, investment can't rise

### 6.4 Example: Developing Countries

- Low savings rates limit investment
- Importance of foreign loans for boosting investment and capital stock
- Historical example: US borrowing from Europe in the 1800s

## 7. Conclusion

- Model explains production, distribution, and allocation of economy's output
- Uses classical assumption of price adjustment to equilibrate supply and demand
- Factor prices equilibrate factor markets
- Interest rate equilibrates supply and demand for goods/services and loanable funds
- Limitations: Does not consider money, trade effects, sticky prices, or changes in factors of production
