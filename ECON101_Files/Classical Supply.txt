# Classical Macroeconomic Theory

## 1. Introduction to Macroeconomics

Macroeconomics is the study of aggregates, phenomena observed to emerge from collective actions of firms or households in an economy. The aggregates include:
- National output
- Employment
- The overall price level
- The balance of payments

For example, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure designed to capture the total output of an economy; which involves households providing labor for wages, firms supplying goods or services for profit, and governments implementing policies for stabilizing demand and supply.

Macroeconomists care a lot about quantifying macroeconomic performance. This is currently assessed by inspecting four key indicators:
1. Employment
2. Price level stability
3. Economic growth
4. Balance of payments

### 1.1 Challenges in Macroeconomics

While the discipline strives for a scientific approach, many questions remain unsolved:
- How should observed behavior be aggregated? 
- How should macroeconomic indicators be measured?
- Is it possible to properly account for all micro behavior in the economy?
- How do such aggregate measures evolve over time?
- Do these measures provide an accurate representation of what is happening in the economy overall?
- How should policy be prescribed to account for known limitations of currently available methods?
- Are we missing any important variables in our models?
- What are the trade-offs between constant growth and inequality?

### 1.2 Time Horizons in Macroeconomic Analysis

To start thinking about these questions, it is useful to distinguish between two time horizons:
1. The short-run
2. The long-run

These do not imply a particular time-frame to analyze, rather they define the set of assumptions we are willing to make, and hence the set of models from which we can draw conclusions about the data collected. The most famous model of macroeconomic performance in the long-run is the classical model.

## 2. The Classical Model: A Long-Run Perspective

The Classical Model is a classic example of such toy models. It was developed from Keynes' General Theory in the 1930s, later formalized by Hicks. Although it is believed to have been first posed around the 1800s, which is why it gets the name "Classical".

### 2.1 Key Assumptions

The Classical Model rests on two key assumptions:
1. **Flexible prices**: In the long-run, prices (including wages) can freely adjust to balance supply and demand.
2. **Full employment of resources**: All available resources, including labor, are fully utilized.

### 2.2 Example: Automotive Industry Scenario

To illustrate these concepts, let's consider a realistic scenario in the automotive industry:

Imagine a mid-sized city with a significant auto manufacturing sector. Initially, the sector employs 10,000 workers producing 500,000 cars annually, meeting market demand at the current price of $30,000 per car.

Suddenly, a breakthrough in automation technology allows manufacturers to double their production efficiency. Now, only 5,000 workers are needed to produce the same 500,000 cars. In the short-run, this might lead to unemployment for 5,000 workers.

However, according to the classical model, in the long-run:

1. **Flexible prices**: The price of cars would fall due to increased supply and reduced production costs. Let's say the price drops to $25,000 per car. This price reduction stimulates higher demand for cars.

2. **Full employment**: The 5,000 unemployed workers would find new jobs in various areas:
   - Some might be retrained to operate and maintain the new automated systems.
   - Others might find work in expanded car dealerships and service centers due to increased car ownership.
   - Some might transition to related industries like auto parts manufacturing or transportation services.
   - The increased productivity and wealth in the city might spur growth in other sectors (e.g., retail, hospitality), creating more job opportunities.

This example illustrates how the classical model envisions an economy adjusting to changes over time:
- Prices adapt to new conditions (cars become cheaper).
- Resources, including labor, are reallocated to maintain full employment.
- Overall economic output increases (more cars are produced and sold, and other sectors grow).

It's important to note that the classical model is a simplification of reality, focusing on long-run outcomes. In the real world, these adjustments take time and may face various frictions. Possible reasons for this include:
- Commodities are bought in large quantities, supplied over a period of time, through futures contracts.
- Wages are set at the time of hiring, also constrained by a written contract.

These contracts have different time-frames, but all would fall under the short-run horizon because they are characterized by "sticky" prices. We will study this scenario when we get to short-run economics.

### 2.3 Fundamental Principles

The fundamental principle of classical theory is that the economy self‐regulates. Classical economists maintain that the economy is always capable of achieving the natural level of real GDP or output, which is the level of real GDP that is obtained when the economy's resources are fully employed. 

While circumstances arise from time to time that cause the economy to fall below or to exceed the natural level of real GDP, self‐adjustment mechanisms exist within the market system that work to bring the economy back to the natural level of real GDP. Hence this school of thought favors a laissez–faire approach to government policy. 

The belief of this assumption rests on **Say's Law**, which states that for any given level of output a necessary increase in income will follow such that the economy is always capable of demanding all of the output that its workers and firms choose to produce.

## 3. Markets in the Classical Model

There are 3 markets considered in the classical model:
1. Labor market
2. Capital market
3. Loan market

The first two are the most important factors of production, while loans are introduced later on as a financing mechanism to induce investment.

## 4. Production Function

### 4.1 General Form

Recall that in the long-run we assume full employment of resources, we can now formalize this as a complete and efficient use of all the capital and labor available in the economy.

The available production technology determines how much output is produced from given amounts of capital and labor. Economists express this relationship using a production function. Letting Y denote the amount of output, we write the production function as:

Y = F(K, L)

Since Macro focuses on aggregates, we assume a particular functional form for all firms in the economy. 

### 4.2 Properties

There are two properties of the functional form of the production function commonly considered:
1. **Constant returns to scale (CRS)**
2. **Diminishing returns to scale (DRS)**

#### 4.2.1 Constant Returns to Scale (CRS)

CRS simply means that a change in the factors of production will lead to the same proportional change in output. Formally:

F(cK, cL) = cF(K, L)

where c is a constant value.

#### 4.2.2 Diminishing Returns to Scale (DRS)

DRS means that as factors of production are increased (e.g., more machines are bought or more people are employed) the output gained will decrease, marginally. Formally:

F(cK, cL) < cF(K, L)

Most production functions have DRS properties.

### 4.3 Cobb-Douglas Production Function

The most famous production function is arguably the Cobb-Douglas function introduced by Charles Cobb and Paul Douglas in 1928:

Y = AK^α L^β

Where:
- Y is output
- A is the total factor productivity
- K is capital
- L is labor
- α and β are output elasticities determined by currently available technology

Recall output elasticities are the percentage change in output for a percentage change in the input. That is, the responsiveness of output to a change in levels of either labor or capital used in production.

#### 4.3.1 Example: Output Elasticities Before and After 2008 Financial Crisis

As a motivational example, I wrote some R code to estimate the output elasticities of capital and labor before and after the financial crisis of 2008. The most striking change is the significant decrease in labor elasticity and increase in capital elasticity from the pre-recession to post-recession period.

Labor Elasticity:
- Pre-recession: 0.1666
- Post-recession: 0.0347

This suggests that after the financial crisis, output became less responsive to changes in labor input. A 1% increase in labor hours would lead to a smaller increase in GDP post-recession compared to pre-recession.

Capital Elasticity:
- Pre-recession: 0.3845
- Post-recession: 0.5703

The elasticity of capital increased substantially, indicating that output became more responsive to changes in capital input after the financial crisis.

Relative Importance: Pre-recession, capital was about 2.3 times more important than labor in determining output. Post-recession, this ratio increased to about 16.4 times, showing a dramatic shift towards capital.

Possible explanations for these changes include:
- Structural Shifts: The economy might have shifted towards more capital-intensive sectors (e.g., tech) and away from labor-intensive ones.
- Labor Market Changes: Post-recession, there might have been changes in labor market dynamics (e.g., gig economy, part-time work) that made output less responsive to changes in total labor hours.
- Investment Patterns: The low interest rates post-recession might have encouraged more capital investment, making the economy more responsive to changes in capital.
- Policy Responses: Government policies post-recession might have favored capital investment over labor (e.g., through tax incentives).
- Data Limitations: My simple model might not capture all complexities, and there could be data or measurement issues affecting the results.

#### 4.3.2 Returns to Scale in Cobb-Douglas Function

Applying the definition of returns at scale to the Cobb-Douglas function:

F(cK, cL) = A(cK)^α (cL)^β = c^(α+β) AK^α L^β = c^(α+β) F(K,L)

This tells us that:
- If α + β = 1, we have CRS
- If α + β < 1, we have DRS

#### 4.3.3 Marginal Products

We are often interested in studying what would happen to output given a change in one of the factors of production. These are called marginal products of a factor of production.

**Marginal Product of Labor (MPL)**:
MPL = ∂Y/∂L = βAK^α L^(β-1)

Since β > 0, we know this value is positive. Hence, an increase in labor leads to an increase in output.

Both MPK and MPL curves are always positive but downward sloping. This suggests that the Cobb-Douglas satisfies the law of "diminishing returns".

In the MPK and MPL curves:
- When α < β (0.3, 0.7), MPL is higher than MPK, indicating labor is more productive.
- When α = β (0.5, 0.5), MPK and MPL are identical, showing equal productivity.
- When α > β (0.7, 0.3), MPK is higher than MPL, suggesting capital is more productive.
- The curves become steeper as the respective elasticity increases, showing a faster decline in marginal productivity.

As we increase either capital or labor, keeping the other constant, we see diminishing returns. The input with the higher elasticity starts off more productive but also experiences a steeper decline in its marginal product.

#### 4.3.4 Second Derivatives and Diminishing Returns

To assess how the rates of increases in output evolve or grow as labor or capital continue to increase, we compute the second partial derivative of the production function.

For labor:
∂^2Y/∂L^2 = β(β-1)AK^α L^(β-2)

This gives us a negative value because β < 1. Thus this function satisfies diminishing returns because the marginal product of labor, while always positive, is declining. A similar analysis can be conducted on the capital (K) input.

In the second derivative curves:
- All curves start in the negative values, a consequence of the diminishing marginal returns.
- The curves converge at 0, showing that the worst-case scenario is that we add one more unit of input and see no productivity increase.
- The steep initial drop indicates that diminishing returns set in quickly, especially for the more productive input.
- As we add more of an input, the rate of decline in its marginal product slows down, as shown by the curves approaching zero.

### 4.4 Generalized Cobb-Douglas Function

We can generalize the Cobb-Douglas function to an arbitrary number of factors of production. The general form is:

Y = A∏(x_i^α_i)

where:
- A is an efficiency parameter
- n is the total number of inputs
- x is a vector of factors of production
- α_i is the output elasticity parameter for each input

## 5. Firm Profit Maximization

Having established a plausible production function, we turn our focus to the objective of the firm producing such goods. Firms want to maximize profit, calculated as price times quantity produced minus costs incurred (wages paid for labor and rents paid for capital).

### 5.1 Profit Function

π = pY - wL - rK

Where:
- π is profit
- p is the price of output
- w is the wage rate
- r is the rental rate of capital

### 5.2 Profit Maximization Conditions

To find the level of labor input that will maximize a firm's profit which produces according to the Cobb-Douglas function:

∂π/∂L = p * ∂Y/∂L - w = pβAK^α L^(β-1) - w = 0
pβAK^α L^(β-1) = w
MPL = w/p (real wage)

Similarly for capital:
MPK = r/p (real rental rate)

We treat prices p and costs w, r as constants because we assume perfect competition, where individual firms have no effect on the price of their output or the wage they pay. They take both as given.

The competitive, profit-maximizing firm follows a simple rule about how much labor to hire and how much capital to rent: The firm demands each factor of production until that factor's marginal product equals its real factor price.

## 6. Income Distribution

This reveals how the markets for the factors of production distribute the economy's total income. If all firms in the economy are competitive and profit maximizing, then each factor of production is paid its marginal contribution to the production process.

Total income (Y) is distributed as:
Y = MPL * L + MPK * K + Economic Profit

where the economic profit is the income that remains after firms have paid their factors of production.

## 7. Demand for Products

The analysis so far concludes the classical analysis of the firm, or of the supply for goods and services, which determines the total income Y in the economy. The text ends with a question about what determines demand for such products, suggesting this as the next topic to be explored.
