Statistical Thinking
Statistical thinking involves understanding the underlying distributions, analyzing data patterns, and drawing meaningful conclusions from data.
Understanding Distributions and Statistics: It is important to understand the relationship between data distributions and summary statistics. Summary statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation provide a numerical summary of the data, but these statistics can often be misleading if the underlying distribution is not taken into account. For example, outliers or skewed distributions can greatly impact the interpretation of the mean.
Data Visualization: Data visualization plays a crucial role in communicating data insights effectively. Visual representations such as graphs and charts help in identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies that may not be immediately apparent from the raw data. They also facilitate comparisons between different categories or datasets, making it easier to draw meaningful conclusions.
Carefully define your question: Think really hard and carefully about the question you are trying to answer. Understand the context and use your institutional knowledge plus logic to articulate the question to be studied.
Statistical Thinking for Daily Life
Statistics is more about a way to make sense of data rather than applying mathematical formulas mindlessly. Practicing statistical reasoning during your daily routine will help you make better decisions, avoid falling into common fallacies, and ultimately will make you a smart consumer of information. 
Contextual Understanding: When interpreting data, it is important to consider the context in which the data was collected. The same data can be interpreted differently in different scenarios or contexts. For example, a decrease in sales may be seen as positive in the context of cost reduction, but negative in terms of revenue generation. Understanding the story behind the numbers helps in making accurate interpretations and avoiding misinterpretations.
Being Skeptical: Critical thinking is crucial when working with data. It is important to be aware of biases, manipulations, or misinterpretations that may be present in the data. This skepticism helps in identifying any potential issues with the data and ensures that the conclusions drawn are robust.
Logical Reasoning: Data analysis should always be accompanied by logical reasoning. It involves using rational thinking and deductive reasoning to draw conclusions from the data. Logical reasoning helps in determining whether the interpretations and conclusions made from the data analysis make sense in the real-world context.
Ethical Considerations: Working with data requires ethical considerations. Respecting confidentiality and privacy is important when dealing with sensitive data. It is also necessary to ensure that the conclusions drawn from the data are not biased or discriminatory. Ethical considerations help in maintaining the integrity of the data analysis process.
Applying these best practices is crucial for minimizing the risk of falling for some common behavioral biases. The following are some of the most important biases recorded in the behavioral economics literature, read “thinking fast and slow” by Khaneman or “Nudge” by Thaler for more information if interested.
Be aware of biases: herd mentality (robinhood - gamestop), loss aversion (cornerstone of behavioral economics because of its meaning for utility preferences), and framing effect (how to read the news).
Herd Mentality: People tend to follow the crowd or consensus without critical evaluation, leading to groupthink and irrational decision-making, like stock market bubbles. Momentum trading strategies exploit this behavioral bias. 

Loss Aversion: Individuals strongly prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains, often resulting in suboptimal risk management and reluctance to make necessary changes in decisions or investments. E.g., Selling stocks too early to lock in small profits while holding onto losing stocks in the hope that they will rebound.

Framing Effect: The presentation of information can influence decision-making; how information is framed can significantly impact perceptions and choices, even if the content is the same. News example.

Confirmation Bias: People seek, interpret, and remember information that confirms their existing beliefs or opinions while ignoring contradictory information, reinforcing biases and hindering objective analysis. E.g., Seeking out news sources that align with our political views and ignoring those with different perspectives.

Anchoring Effect: Individuals rely too heavily on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions, even if it's irrelevant, which can lead to suboptimal negotiations and financial choices. E.g., Negotiating a price based on an initial high offer, even if it's unreasonable.

Availability Heuristics: Judgments are made based on the ease with which relevant examples or information come to mind, often resulting in inaccurate assessments of probabilities and risks due to the salience of certain events. E.g., overestimating the likelihood of rare events because they are more memorable or have recently received media attention.

EXAMPLE:
Headline 1: "Economic Recovery in Full Swing as Unemployment Rate Drops to 4%"
Headline 2: "Economic Uncertainty Persists Despite Slight Drop in Unemployment Rate to 4%"
In this scenario, both headlines are reporting the same news about the unemployment rate dropping to 4%. However, the framing of the information is different:
Headline 1 frames the news in a positive light, emphasizing the "Economic Recovery" and suggesting a positive outlook.
Headline 2 frames the news with a more cautious and uncertain tone, highlighting "Economic Uncertainty" despite the drop in the unemployment rate.
Now, you can discuss with your students how these different framings can impact the way people perceive the news and make decisions:
Perception: People who read Headline 1 might feel more optimistic about the economy and may be more inclined to invest or make positive financial decisions. On the other hand, those who read Headline 2 might be more cautious and may hesitate to make financial decisions due to the emphasized "Economic Uncertainty."
Decision-Making: Discuss how individuals' reactions to the same news could vary based on the framing. Some may see it as a green light to invest, while others might see it as a yellow caution signal, influencing their investment choices.
Media Influence: Emphasize the role of media in framing news to attract readers and discuss how this can lead to biased or skewed perceptions of reality.


Frequency/Density Functions
Frequency Function (Discrete Data): For discrete data, the frequency function is used to calculate the relative frequency of a variable taking values in a subset. It takes two parameters: the variable under study and the subset we want to check for. The frequency function returns the relative frequency with which the variable takes a value included in the subset.
Frequency Function (Continuous Data): For continuous data, the frequency function is replaced by the density function. The density function represents the relative likelihood of observing a value within an interval. It is denoted as f(x) and satisfies properties such as being non-negative and integrating to 1 over its entire domain. The density function allows us to calculate the probability of observing values within specific intervals.
Cumulative Frequency Function: The cumulative frequency function provides insights into the probability of a random variable being less than or equal to a given value. For continuous random variables, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is defined as the integral of the density function up to that value. For discrete random variables, the CDF is the sum of probabilities up to that value.



Properties of Frequency and Cumulative Frequency Functions
Discrete Data: The cumulative frequency function is a step function and is bounded from above and below. It has discontinuity points that correspond to the values of the random variable. The cumulative function is continuous from the right at these discontinuity points, which means that the probability of a random variable taking a specific value is equal to the height of the step.
Continuous Data: The cumulative frequency function is monotonic and non-decreasing, representing the cumulative probability of observing values less than or equal to a given value. The cumulative function is continuous and has no discontinuity points. The slope of the cumulative function in each interval represents the density in that interval. Taking the derivative of the cumulative function gives the density function for continuous random variables.



Visualizing Frequency Tables and Data
Importance of Visualization: Visualizations are powerful tools for summarizing and understanding data. They allow us to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies that may not be immediately apparent from the raw numbers. Visuals also enhance the interpretation of data by providing a more intuitive way to understand and explain the data to others. They facilitate comparisons between different categories or datasets, aiding in making informed decisions and drawing meaningful insights. Additionally, visualizations turn data into a compelling story, allowing us to convey specific messages and narratives about the data.
Bar Charts: Bar charts are a common way to visualize frequency tables. They display the distribution of categorical data using rectangular bars, where the height of each bar corresponds to the frequency of the category it represents. Bar charts help identify outliers or unusual data points, compare frequencies of different categories, and communicate data insights effectively.
Histograms: Histograms are used to visualize the distribution of continuous data. They divide the range of data into intervals (bins) and represent the frequency of observations falling within each bin using rectangular bars. Histograms provide a visual representation of the shape of the distribution, allowing us to identify the central tendency and variability of the data. They help in identifying outliers, skewness, or multimodality in the data.
Pie Charts: Pie charts are used to represent the proportion or percentage distribution of categorical data. Each category is represented as a slice of the pie, with the size of each slice corresponding to the proportion of data in that category. Pie charts help visualize the relative sizes of different categories within the whole and facilitate comparisons between different groups.
Box Plots: Box plots, also known as box-and-whisker plots, provide a graphical summary of the distribution of continuous data. They display the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum values through a box-and-whisker structure. Box plots help identify outliers, visualize the spread and skewness of the data, and compare distributions between different groups.
Scatterplots: Scatterplots are used to visualize the relationship between two continuous variables. Each data point is represented as a point on the plot, with one variable on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis. Scatterplots help identify patterns, trends, and the strength of the relationship between the variables. They play a key role in regression analysis and econometrics.
