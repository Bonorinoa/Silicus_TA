It provides methods and techniques to make sense of data and draw conclusions or make predictions based on the information available. \n\nRegarding your second question, yes, there can be multiple interpretations of statistics. This is because statistics can be used in various contexts and applied to different types of data. Different interpretations may arise depending on the specific goals, assumptions, and methods used in a particular analysis. For example, in the frequentist approach to statistics, probabilities are interpreted as long-run frequencies. On the other hand, the Bayesian approach incorporates prior beliefs and knowledge into the analysis. \n\nIt's important to note that each interpretation has its own strengths and limitations, and the choice of interpretation often depends on the specific problem being addressed and the available data."

If MongoDB is installed, it should start up the MongoDB server. \n\nNext, you can test if MongoDB is running by connecting to it using a MongoDB client. You can use the command \"mongo\" in your terminal or command prompt to open the MongoDB shell. If you are able to connect to the shell without any errors, it means MongoDB is running properly.\n\nYou can also test if you can perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a MongoDB database. You can try creating a new document, reading an existing document, updating a document, and deleting a document. If you are able to perform these operations without any errors, it indicates that MongoDB is working correctly.\n\nI hope this helps you in testing if MongoDB works locally.
